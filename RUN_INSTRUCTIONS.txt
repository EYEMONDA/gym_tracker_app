Gym Tracker App — Run Instructions

This project is a Flutter app (web-first) that also runs on iOS/Android later.

1) Prerequisites
- Install Flutter SDK (includes Dart): https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
- Verify your setup:
  flutter doctor

2) Get dependencies (from the repo root)
  flutter pub get

3) Run as a web app (recommended for now)
- Enable web support (one-time per machine):
  flutter config --enable-web
- Run in Chrome:
  flutter run -d chrome

4) Run on Android (optional)
- Install Android Studio + Android SDK, then:
  flutter doctor
- Start an emulator or plug in a device with USB debugging, then:
  flutter run -d android

5) Run on iOS (optional; requires macOS)
- Install Xcode + iOS tooling, then:
  flutter doctor
- Then:
  flutter run -d ios

6) Build a release web bundle
  flutter build web --release

Where is data stored?
- There is NO login.
- Data is stored locally using SharedPreferences.
  - On mobile: platform key/value storage.
  - On web: browser local storage backing (implementation detail of the plugin).

Troubleshooting
- If flutter isn’t found: add the Flutter SDK bin/ to your PATH.
- If web device not found:
  flutter config --enable-web
  flutter devices

Notes for this workspace environment
- If you’re running in a remote/container environment that doesn’t have Flutter installed, install Flutter on your local machine to run the app.
