Gym Tracker — Product Description (No Login, Web-First)

Overview
Gym Tracker is a web-based fitness tracker designed to be converted into a cross‑platform native app later (iOS/Android/Desktop) with minimal rework. It intentionally has NO login and stores everything locally.

Core Features Implemented
- Dynamic-Island-inspired top UI
  - A centered “pill” overlay at the top of the screen.
  - Tap to expand into a smart search panel.
  - Shows an always-available rest timer in compact mode.
  - Focus Mode: when a workout is active, the Island morphs into a quick logger (one-tap “Add set”).
  - Subtle state lighting: green glow for active workout logging, amber glow for rest timer.

- Workout tracker (live session)
  - Start a workout session.
  - Add exercises.
  - Add sets (reps + weight + unit).
  - Automatically starts a rest timer after adding a set.
  - Save workout to local history.

- Workout logger / history
  - List saved sessions.
  - Open a session detail view showing exercises and sets.

- Calendar
  - Smart month view with markers:
    - planned routine count per day
    - completed workout count per day
  - Tap a day to see:
    - Planned routines (multiple per day) with Start/Skip/Delete actions
    - Completed workouts for that day
  - “Plan” button lets you schedule multiple routines on the same date (with optional time label like AM/PM/18:00).

- Smart schedule (lightweight)
  - Suggests the next workout day based on:
    - your preferred training days (Mon–Sun toggles)
    - your most recent workout
  - Routine templates can be quick-started (and used for planning via Calendar).

- Smart ID ("Smart encryption ID")
  - A local, privacy-preserving identifier generated randomly and stored locally.
  - Used as an offline “identity anchor” without accounts.
  - Can be copied/regenerated in Settings.

Design Goals
- Web-first but native-ready: build once, ship everywhere.
- No account friction: immediate use, fully offline.
- Dark/black theme: optimized for gym environments and OLED screens.
- Fast interaction: Dynamic Island overlay keeps search + timers always reachable.

What was used (and why)
- Flutter (UI framework)
  - Why: One codebase for web + iOS + Android + desktop.
  - Why: Rapid UI iteration and strong component model.

- Material 3 + custom dark theme
  - Why: Modern UI foundations and accessibility defaults.
  - Why: We force a black/dark palette to match the requested aesthetic.

- SharedPreferences (local persistence)
  - Why: Simple, reliable storage for an offline-first prototype.
  - How: The app persists a small JSON “database” blob with sessions and preferences.

- A simple local data model (JSON)
  - Why: Enables richer data than a list of strings (sessions → exercises → sets).
  - Why: Keeps future migration paths open (export/import, syncing, analytics).

- Smart schedule logic (rule-based)
  - Why: No backend, no ML required.
  - Why: Still provides helpful suggestions based on behavior.

- Smart search (in the Dynamic Island)
  - Why: Quickly add exercises from past sessions; fast navigation.
  - How: Searches across recent sessions + the active session.

Where things live in the code
- App entry/theme: lib/main.dart
- App state + persistence + Smart ID: lib/state/app_state.dart
- Tab shell + overlay: lib/ui/root_shell.dart
- Dynamic Island: lib/ui/widgets/dynamic_island.dart
- Screens:
  - Workout: lib/ui/screens/workout_screen.dart
  - Log: lib/ui/screens/log_screen.dart
  - Calendar: lib/ui/screens/calendar_screen.dart
  - Schedule: lib/ui/screens/schedule_screen.dart
  - Settings: lib/ui/screens/settings_screen.dart

Current limitations (intentional for v1)
- No cloud sync and no login.
- No export/import yet (recommended next if you want device-to-device portability).
- Encryption is not end-to-end yet; the Smart ID is an offline identifier, not encrypted storage.

Recommended next upgrades
- Export/import (encrypted) using the Smart ID as a key-derivation seed.
- Templates (workout plans) + quick-add.
- Better calendar markers (dots on days with workouts).
- More advanced “smart schedule” (splits like PPL, Full Body, Upper/Lower).

Update policy
- Keep this file updated as features are added/changed so it always reflects what the app does and why the architecture choices were made.
